# this is a git repository for my personal LED matrix project. 
### don't expect crazy high quality code or anything, this is all done as a hobby.
## current plans:
### >write debug environment that can run in a window instead of on the actual lights. basically write an API for myself to call later with convenience functions like "drawPixel()" that can be later swapped out to control the lights on the real deal. OOP stuff ecksdee
### >probably do this all in python *first* and then switch to a higher performance language like C++ or Rust
### >maybe some FFI stuff? not sure how much i want to punch myself in the dick on this project really.
### >final goal is to have some form of audio visualizer, probably linking cava and rendering visuals at a very low resolution?
