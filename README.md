# this is a git repository for my personal LED matrix project. 
### don't expect crazy high quality code or anything, this is all done as a hobby.
## current plans:
>~~write debug environment that can run in a window instead of on the actual lights. basically write an API for myself to call later with convenience functions like "drawPixel()" that can be later swapped out to control the lights on the real deal. OOP stuff ecksdee~~ 

***DONE! Implemented in Java, using a socket listener to take in new pixel data.***

>~~probably do the complex graphical algorithms all in python *first* and then switch to a higher performance native compiled language like C++ or Rust~~


***I have instead elected to use C#, something of an awkward middle ground. If I really do need to change it over to C++, it _probably_ won't be that difficult. Right?***


>final goal is to have some form of audio visualizer, probably linking cava and rendering visuals at a very low resolution?
